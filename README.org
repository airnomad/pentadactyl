* Pentadactyl Configuration

This setup is heavily inspired  to Emacs, while the original intent of
Pentadactyl is to mimic Vi editor.

The present code is mainly borrowed (read stolen)  from the [[http://sysphere.org/~anrxc/j/articles/vimperator/index.html][Adrian C. (anrxc)]].


* Bookmarklets

Unfortunately Delicious  does not allow any more  to save bookmarklets
in its DB,  since it force “http://” and “https://” to  be a prefix of
an URL.

The file “./bookmarklets.html” should be ready importable in any browser.
